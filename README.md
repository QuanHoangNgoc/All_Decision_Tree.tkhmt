## üåü **What is it?**
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on Decision Trees, a fundamental machine learning algorithm. It covers everything from the basics of decision tree structures to complex applications like multiclass classification and regression. The content is designed to offer a clear and detailed understanding of how decision trees work, how they can be applied, and the advantages they offer in specific scenarios.

## üéØ **Why do we do it?**
Decision Trees are powerful yet interpretable models that are widely used in machine learning. Despite their simplicity, they offer substantial flexibility in handling various types of data and can serve as the backbone for more complex models like Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees. This repository aims to demystify decision trees and provide users with the knowledge to apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.

## üë• **Who is the User?**
This repository is designed for:
- **Students**: Seeking to understand the basics of machine learning and decision tree algorithms.
- **Data Scientists & Machine Learning Practitioners**: Looking for a detailed guide and practical examples to enhance their understanding.
- **Educators**: Who need a comprehensive resource to teach decision trees.

### üé¨ **Demo & Results**
To see the decision tree in action, check out the [Google Colab demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oFhCdeEUeVT21CSJTo5KT00ACeNxCnqL?usp=sharing) and the associated [GitHub source code](https://github.com/QuanHoangNgoc/All_Decision_Tree_Hoang_Ngoc_Quan_22521178). These demos walk you through building and visualizing decision trees, allowing you to grasp how they function in practice.
